> ### How the app works
> The app is pretty self explanatory, there are a few hidden trick though.
> There are two menu button in the top right corner to switch between views.
> #### Hidden Features:
> - Click and hold a cell to add a booking to that specific cell.
> - Hover your mouse over a booking in week or day view to change the booking's end time.
>
> #### Known Issues:
> - When booking is created the UI does not check if  booking in the same room overlaps another booking in that room.
> - All report data is dummy data.
